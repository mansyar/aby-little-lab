# Performance Baseline — Boot-Time Asset Profiling

Track: `perf-bundle-hardening_20260809`, Phase 3 (measure-first). Date: 2026-08-09.

## Method

1. Instrumented `PreloadScene.preload()` with dev-only timing (aggregate SVG
   load/rasterization duration, file count, avg ms/file, slowest single-file
   delta) — logged only when `import.meta.env.DEV` (dead-code-eliminated in
   production builds).
2. Dev-server measurement (`pnpm dev`, Chromium headless via playwright-cli):
   captures the rasterization pipeline for all 152 SVGs.
3. Production-preview measurement (`pnpm exec vite preview --port 4173`,
   same browser): Navigation Timing API duration + request-level chunk
   verification.

## Results

| Metric | Measured | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| SVG preload (152 files, dev pipeline) | 641 ms total, avg 4 ms/file, slowest 289 ms | — | — |
| Full boot (production preview, navigation duration) | 1080.7 ms | < 3000 ms | PASS |
| Shell chunk request | `index-B7QCy6Jd.js` 134.0 kB | — | — |
| Vendor chunk request | `phaser-CYX5YQB3.js` 1,343.5 kB | — | — |
| SVG raster requests at boot | ~152 blob requests | — | expected |

The 152-SVG rasterization consumes ~21% of the 3 s boot budget on the
reference (desktop) profile — no gap proven.

## Decision (AC5)

**No optimization applied.** Per the measure-first decision gate, the
rasterization cost stays well within budget on the reference profile; the
slowest single file (289 ms, first-file bootstrap) is not actionable. No
asset-raster-size changes and no per-game asset lazy-loading were introduced
(spec Out of Scope: shared textures make lazy-loading risky without a proven
tier-level bottleneck).

## Recommended follow-ups (out of scope, not scheduled)

- Re-run this measurement on a low-end Android tablet (4× CPU throttle
  estimate: ~2.5 s worst case for the full preload) before considering
  raster-size reductions for small-display assets.
- The dev/prod instrumentation is intentionally dev-only; if a permanent
  perf-regression gate is ever wanted, promote the timing into the
  `validate-*` script family with a CI threshold.
